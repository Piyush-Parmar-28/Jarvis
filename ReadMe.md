# JARVIS
Hi everyone. I have created a Virtual Assistant (just like Iron-Man Jarvis), using Python.

It responds to the user commands & acts accordingly.

Some of its commands are: 
-how are you
-fine
-open wikipedia
-open youtube
-open google
-open chrome
-open vs code
-play music
-what's the time
-what's your your name 
-change your name
-who made you
-who are you
-tell me a joke
-who am i
-open powerpoint
-open excel
-open word
-empty recycle bin
-where is <location>
-write a note
 -show note
 -exit
